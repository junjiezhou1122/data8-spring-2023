    "**Total variation distance (TVD)** is a special type of test statistic that we use when we want to compare two distributions of *categorical data*. It is often used when we observe that a set of observed proportions/probabilities is different than what we expect under the null model. \n",

    "Consider a six-sided die that we roll 6,000 times. If the die is fair, we would expect that each face comes up $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the time. By random chance, a fair die won't always result in equal proportions (that is, we won't get exactly 1,000 of each face). However, if we suspect that the die might be unfair based on the data, we can conduct a hypothesis test using TVD to compare the expected [$\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$] distribution to what is actually observed.\n",
